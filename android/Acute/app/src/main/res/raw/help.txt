=====introduce=====\n\t
The app uses the distance difference between speakers and two microphones and the sound speed to estimate the temperature.\n\t
This app can view real-time temperature, real-time peek frequency and real-time FFT.\n
Temperature is obtained by formula :\n\t\t\tTemp = Bd/λfT - c0/λ\n\t
B: fmax - fmin,the bandwidth of chirp signal\n
d: speaker to two-Microphone distance difference\n
T: the duration of chirp signal\n
f: the peek frequency of mixed power spectrum\n
λ = 0.606 and c0 = 331 are two constants.\n
All variables can be set in setting\n\n
Matters need attenetion!\n
1.The volume should be as low as possible\n
2.Test in an open and quiet place\n
