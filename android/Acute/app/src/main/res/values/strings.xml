The app uses the distance difference between speakers and two microphones and the sound speed to estimate the temperature.\n\t
This app can view real-time temperature, real-time peek frequency and real-time FFT.\n
Temperature is obtained by formula :\nc*c = α*Temp f = dB/cT\nc:the speed of voice\n
B: fmax - fmin,the bandwidth of chirp signal\n
d: speaker to two-Microphone distance difference\n
T: the duration of chirp signal\nf: the peek frequency of mixed power spectrum\n
α = 403 are two constants.\n
All variables can be set in settings.Parameter d can be calibrated in calibration.\n
Matters need attenetion!\n
1.The volume should be as low as possible\n
2.Test in an open and quiet place,especially when calibrating parameter d\n</string>
